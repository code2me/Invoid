# ID Authentication App

The purpose of ID Authentication App is to turn your customer's smartphone into an ID verification terminal that uploads and verifies their ID and other credentials quickly and easily to meet KYC standards. 
This allows clients to do everyday operations from their homes rather than coming to service centres, 
where the corporation requires a large number of inefficient workers. 
It also saves time and money by eliminating the need for manual documentation for submission and verification.
